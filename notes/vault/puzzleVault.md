# PuzzleVault

## About the PuzzleVault
The PuzzleVault is a personal cryptography vault developed to manage personal cryptography.  its function is similar to software commonly known as 'wallets' but, its structure is different and it is intended to function as part of the broader 'vault' functionality.  It is intended to be produced as a W3C Human Centric AI CG Recommendation, providing as a set of processes and syntax to support social web and Human Centric AI functionality.  The primary function of PuzzleVault is to provide the means to create, store, manage and work with cryptography and cryptographic 'secrets', to support the management of relationships, permissions and access to network resources. PuzzleVault stores security information storing secrets about the relationships between agents that have been associated with the user at some-time and makes related information accountably managable. 

The PuzzleVault is intended to be used with the Webizen Directory.  

Here's a list of functionality that will be sought to be developed into the PuzzleVault:


Based on the functionalities and features mentioned in the text about PuzzleVault, the following table categorizes the various elements of the system:

| Category                  | Specific Elements |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Authentication**        | - Usernames and passwords <br> - Contact information <br> - Login scripts |
| **Cryptography Management**| - Cryptography library <br> - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) <br> - Wallet Private Keys <br> - Encryption and decryption processes |
| **Credential Storage**    | - Credentials for various accounts <br> - Password manager functionality <br> - Password generation <br> - Wi-Fi network passwords |
| **API Integration**       | - Storage and management of API keys <br> - System integration with other web services and applications |
| **Access Control**        | - Permissions management <br> - Access control policies <br> - Digital certificates, private keys, public keys |
| **Secure Storage**        | - Secure notes <br> - Form data (including personal details) <br> - Biometric data |
| **Network Resources**     | - Shared resource information (e.g., folders, printers) <br> - Computer account attributes (e.g., computer name, network address) |
| **Personal Information**  | - Contacts (people or organizations) <br> - Payment instruments (e.g., credit card details) |

The PuzzleVault aims to be comprehensive in managing personal cryptography and credentials, providing a secure environment for the creation, storage, and management of sensitive data, as well as facilitating access control and integration with other systems within the context of a social web and Human Centric AI.
