# Bookmarks.md

"Bookmarks" is work in progress.  The bookmark concept is far broader than traditional bookmarks, the modelling seeks to create a 'pointed graph' based upon the URI, which may in-turn support various social structures that are also associated to that URI, and related permissions.

There likely need to be a new name for this type of 'bookmark', related existing terms include;
- social bookmarks
- semantic bookmarks

As bookmarks are associated to specifications, the means to ensure fresh specifications can be defined is usefully important.
